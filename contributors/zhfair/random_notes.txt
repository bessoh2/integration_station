Cryo2Sat
--------------------
Overall, the data overlap between ICESat-2 and Cryosat2 is limited. The main Cryo2Ice program occured for two weeks in July 2020, mostly in the polar regions.

ICESat-2 ATL06 has a few data points in/near Grand Mesa in the past year, as does Cryosat2.
    - ICESat-2 has ~6 granules that pass over Western Colorado in February 2020. Need to narrow this down with Icepyx.
    - Cryosat2 data is tricky to visualize. Need to find out when it passes over Grand Mesa (and how to find out).


Icepyx
-------------------
Basically designed to simplify the data querying/downloading process for ICESat-2.

With the package, three functions are needed to get ICESat-2 data:
    ipx.Query(short_name, spatial_extent, date_range)
        short_name: String for dataset short name (e.g. 'ATL06')
        spatial_extent: Bounding box of coordinates ([-90,-180,90,180])
        date_range: Set of strings for the sate range (['yyyy-mm-dd', yyyy-mm-dd'])

    region.earthdata_login(uid, email)
        uid: String for Earthdata username
        email: String for personal email

    region.download_granules(path)
        path: String for the directory to download data into


ASO
-----------------------
Performed flights for SnowEx over Grand Mesa.

Some data is currently available from February 2020, specifically for February 1-2 and 13th.

Both dates have TIF files for snow depth, SWE, and snow-free DEMs over Grand Mesa.
